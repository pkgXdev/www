1. https://pkgx.sh
2. https://pkgx.dev
3. https://pkgx.app
4. https://blog.pkgx.dev

Pushing to `main` deploys all three. See `cd.yml` for details.

Note that pages in the React Router are handled by a CloudFront Function
on the CloudFront Distribution.

* The “Shader” font’s license stipulates that it only be published to a CDN
  or web platform that we control so it is not committed to GitHub
